# phase-flow v2 (`shipwright`)

Self-contained Cursor plugin for the unified phase-flow v2 development workflow. All commands use the
`pf-` prefix. Infrastructure seams (CI gate, memory, AI review, stabilize loop, hooks) are vendored in-tree
from phase-flow v1 and compound-engineering patterns — no runtime dependency on sibling plugins.

## Install (local development)

Authoring lives under `core/`; installable trees are **generated** and committed under `dist/`.

```bash
python3 -m pf generate --all   # after editing core/
./scripts/sync-local-install.sh   # rsync dist/cursor/ → ~/.cursor/plugins/local/phase-flow-v2
```

Then **Developer: Reload Window** in Cursor.

Default install path: `~/.cursor/plugins/local/phase-flow-v2`

For Claude Code, point your plugin path at `dist/claude-code/` (or copy it to your Claude plugins directory).

## Configuration

Copy the example config into your target repo, or run `/pf-setup` for guided scaffolding:

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor
cp core/pf-reference/workflow.config.example.json .cursor/workflow.config.json
# edit memory.project, verify.*, and provider selection
```

Fresh installs can use **zero-config in-repo memory**: commit `.cursor/pf-memory.provider` (containing
`in-repo`) plus empty `.cursor/pf-memory/{memories,rules}/` — no `workflow.config.json` required until you
run `/pf-setup`.

Provider **selection** lives in config; API credentials are sourced from the environment / secret store at
runtime — never commit secrets.

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `memory.provider` | Active memory adapter (`in-repo` default in example; `recallium` also supported) |
| `review.provider` | Active AI review adapter (`coderabbit` default) |
| `coderabbit.reviewGraceMinutes` | Gate grace window before absent review = settled |
| `checks.treatNeutralAsPass` | NEUTRAL checks count as pass unless allowlisted |
| `checks.neutralAllowlist` | Check names that stay blocking |
| `memory.autoSync` | Stop-hook thresholds for `/pf-memory-sync` scheduling |

See `core/pf-reference/config.schema.json` for the full schema.
